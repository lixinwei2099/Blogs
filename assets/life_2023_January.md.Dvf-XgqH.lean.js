It feels like just yesterday I graduated from college, and yet time seems to fly by faster and faster every year. Sometimes, I find myself thinking about how I've already been out of school for over a year and a half. As each new year approaches, it reminds me that I am getting older, but I don't worry too much about my age.

People may ask if I miss my parents, and the answer is yes, I miss them dearly. However, the cost of traveling home is quite expensive and I would only be able to stay for a few short days.

I have a lot of work to do, including fixing numerous bugs. My goal is to launch my blog by the end of this month, but it&#39;s already May 28th and I&#39;m worried that I won&#39;t be able to finish everything on time. I&#39;m feeling exhausted and stressed out, but my colleague tells me to take it easy and not rush everything. She says that if I can&#39;t finish my work today, I can always do it tomorrow. I&#39;m trying to learn to fix bugs in a relaxed way, without pushing myself too hard.</p><p>However, I must admit that when my leader assigns me to fix a bug, I feel a bit fearful. I worry that I won&#39;t be able to do it well. I wonder why he doesn&#39;t fix the bugs himself - maybe it&#39;s because it&#39;s difficult to find the issues in the code, especially since there are thousands of lines of code written by other developers. Sometimes he gives me tasks he doesn&#39;t want to do himself. If I tell him that I can&#39;t fix a bug, he might insult me and make me feel terrible. But I don&#39;t care what he says - I&#39;m just here to make a living.</p><p>From now on, I&#39;ve decided to prioritize completing my admin project and finishing my computer hardware course. Over the next few days, I plan to enjoy the end of this month without pushing myself too hard. I&#39;ll take a more relaxed approach and not be too strict with myself. I hope to take things one at a time and work slowly and steadily. I believe that one day I will be able to do well and become an excellent programmer.</p><h3 id="endless-and-exhausting-meetings" tabindex="-1">Endless and Exhausting Meetings <a class="header-anchor" href="#endless-and-exhausting-meetings" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Endless and Exhausting Meetings&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>I find myself exhausted due to the endless meetings I have to attend at work. This month, I am required to join meetings every week, even after finishing work at 8 pm. Attending these meetings leaves me feeling tired and breathless. It&#39;s frustrating because I need some rest after work, but instead, I have to attend these long and often unproductive meetings.</p><p>In the mornings, I sit down at my workstation, and within a few minutes, the leader will ask me to join a meeting. As a junior front-end developer, I feel confused about why he wants me to participate in the database establishment. I don&#39;t think I have the required skills, and I&#39;m not sure if this is a standard work process.</p><p>The truth is, we only have five developers in our department, and everyone is so busy fixing bugs assigned by the leader. I believe the leader asked me to join because there is no one else available. He said it would help me understand the database, but I feel that I only need to know about the table relationships, and I don&#39;t need to refactor the entire database.</p><p>During these meetings, we discuss endlessly from 10 am to 8 pm, with very little progress made. The efficiency is low, and when I make a mistake, the leader insults me. I hope we can finish this meeting quickly, but unfortunately, we haven&#39;t accomplished much yet. We still need to discuss the database next week.</p>',11)]))}const f=t(i,[["render",o]]);export{c as __pageData,f as default};

Every week, I have two lessons, each lasting thirty minutes. That gives me enough time to talk with my tutors. I'm fortunate to have friendly tutors, and I prefer female teachers around my age. Women usually tend to be kind and patient with students, and that's how I stereotype female teachers. Anyway, I've finally found my favorite tutor, and she's really nice. After each class, I feel a sense of comfort. It's like I've struck gold, finding such a wonderful tutor.",-1),e("p",null,`Now, let's talk about the music concert. Trying something new has always been a challenge for me. I've never been to a music concert before, mainly because I don't know much about music and I can't play any instruments like the piano or violin. Perhaps I suffer from imposter syndrome, making me feel like I'm not good enough to enjoy a music concert. I feel undeserving of such beautiful music. But my boyfriend reassured me, saying, "You absolutely deserve it," and convinced me to give it a shot. During the Dragon Festival, we attended a Ghibli music concert. We were completely immersed in the enchanting melodies. I still remember when I was a child, my mother bought DVDs of movies like Totoro and Castle in the Sky, which hold cherished memories from my childhood. Hearing the musicians perform the songs almost brought tears to my eyes. It was an incredible experience for me.`,-1)]))}const g=n(r,[["render",o]]);export{f as __pageData,g as default};

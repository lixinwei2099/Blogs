I really love a song called "Try," which is the theme song of the movie "Fame." I searched for this song on Bilibili and came across many movie clips. It made me think, why not watch the movie? So after I finished tidying up the table, I laid on my bed and opened my iPad to search for the movie. Actually, I had no idea what the movie was about before watching it. I simply loved the theme song.',-1),e("p",null,"I must say, this movie truly inspired me. Every protagonist in the film had passion and worked hard for their dreams. Some faced financial deceit, others accepted that they lacked talent in ballet and couldn't become a dancer, while some experienced sexual harassment during auditions.

We often see glamorous superstars and actors, but we don't know how much effort and sweat they've put into their careers.",-1),e("p",null,"However, the most impactful lines from the actors in the movie were about success.

Instead, you feel excited about what you're doing. Well, I hope that one day I can find my dream job because currently, going to work feels so painful for me.",-1),e("p",null,`The most classic scene in the movie is when the male protagonist plays the piano for the female protagonist in his restaurant. The female protagonist asks him if he can sing a song for her, and they sit down together. She watches him play the piano, while he sings the song for her. This scene almost brought me to tears because the boy puts in so much effort and tries repeatedly to show his love for the girl. The song he sings is called "Try." If anyone reading this article hasn't listened to this song, I highly recommend it. I bet you will love it.`,-1)]))}const p=o(n,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,p as default};

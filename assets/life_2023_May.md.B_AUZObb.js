May your month be as beautiful as the flowers in bloom.&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>It just occurred to me that it&#39;s already May 23rd, and I realized that I need to write a blog. Overall, everything is going well. I can remember what has happened this month, but there is something that&#39;s been bothering me - my work. I constantly feel like I&#39;m not good enough and that there is so much more for me to learn. To be honest, I feel quite anxious even when I have some downtime. Unfortunately, I have to admit that despite my efforts to learn, I tend to forget what I&#39;ve learned. As I&#39;m getting older, it feels like I frequently forget a lot of important things. Perhaps I&#39;m not retaining information deeply enough in my mind, and I&#39;m just making excuses for myself.</p><p>I&#39;ve been working here for about six months now, and time has flown by quickly. Unfortunately, summer is approaching, which means I have to work until 7 PM. By the time I get home, it&#39;s already 8 PM. After dinner and a shower, it&#39;s already 10 PM, and that&#39;s when I usually watch some funny videos on YouTube. Before I know it, it&#39;s time to sleep. I hardly have any time to rest after dinner, making it easier for me to gain weight quickly.</p><p>My boyfriend and I have noticed that we&#39;ve been gaining weight lately. As the end of the month approaches, we&#39;ve made a decision to start losing weight. We plan to cook our own meals and incorporate healthier foods into our diet, such as vegetables, fruits, and lean meats. We&#39;ll use only a small amount of seasoning to enhance the flavor of our dishes. This way, we can maintain a healthy and affordable diet.</p><p>However, there is a drawback to cooking our own mealsâ€”it can be time-consuming. After we finish cooking, we also have to wash the dishes and plates. On the other hand, if we opt for take-out, it will cost us more money and, most importantly, it won&#39;t be as healthy. Restaurants often use excessive oil and seasoning in their dishes. Therefore, we have decided to give up ordering take-out altogether.</p><p>There are three things we need to quit to achieve our health goals: bubble tea, snacks, and desserts. We understand that these indulgences can hinder our progress. With summer approaching, we want our bodies to feel lighter and more fit. We are determined to prioritize our health and stick to our plan.</p><p>Living a healthy life is no easy task. It requires tremendous effort and dedication. Personally, I have made significant efforts to educate myself on the subject by watching YouTube videos on healthy eating and cooking. Among the many channels I explored, I stumbled upon a remarkable one called &quot;Nihonjinfufu.&quot; This channel features a Japanese couple living in Taiwan, and I have learned invaluable lessons from them.</p><p>Not only do they share delicious and nutritious recipes, but they also embody a spirit of treating life with reverence and mindfulness. Their approach to food and overall well-being has had a profound impact on me. If you are currently reading this blog, I highly recommend watching their videos.

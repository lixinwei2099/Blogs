I have been through a tough time this year and made an important decision that has changed my life. Now, I am living a life I never imagined before. If you are my friend, I think you already know what I am talking about. In the beginning of 2022, I decided to leave my friends and family to move to Beijing. I had never been to the north city in my life, and it was my first time in Beijing. Finally, it took me two weeks to find a new job. Well, it doesn&#39;t seem bad. I always think time can prove what is right and what is wrong. No matter what I choose to do, I can bear everything life gives to me.</p><p>Although I initially struggled with learning new things, I found that with time and practice, I was able to overcome my fears and become more confident in my abilities. When I begin to do something new, I often imagine it will be difficult and I am afraid of making mistakes. However, I know my weaknesses, so I have to overcome myself. Starting is hard, and the pressure can be difficult to bear. Luckily, I have received a lot of kindness that has made me feel supported. Without that, maybe I wouldn&#39;t have been able to stick to it. When I feel unhappy, my friends and family always encourage me and give me favors. The most important thing is that I have met a lot of friends. We can solve tough problems and we love to help each other. I won&#39;t forget this period of time.</p><p>While there were certainly moments when I felt discouraged or overwhelmed, the kindness and support of my friends and family helped me to stay motivated and focused on my goals. Maybe someone doesn&#39;t like their job, and I can say that sometimes I have this feeling too. In a few instances, after I finished work, I would spend an hour on the crowded subway to come back home, feeling really tired and not wanting to do anything. I would just eat dinner and watch videos before going to bed, and when I wake up, I have to go back to work and repeat the cycle. It seems so boring, but that&#39;s my life. Also, I don&#39;t like it when my boss pushes me to work and expects me to complete everything perfectly in a limited amount of time. Although I do my best, I can&#39;t always make everyone satisfied with my work. I have to admit that I used to want recognition from other people, but now I realize that it&#39;s not about pleasing everyone else, but about doing my best and finding joy in the simple things in life.</p><p>In the end, I learned that it&#39;s not always about being perfect or pleasing everyone else, but about doing the best I can and finding joy in the simple things in life. As I look ahead to 2023, I feel excited and hopeful about what the future holds, and I am determined to continue growing and learning in all areas of my life. I hope that in 2023, I will be able to create something interesting on my own.</p><p>Thanks for reading my 2022 summary.</p><h2 id="my-experience-during-covid-19-lockdown" tabindex="-1">My Experience during COVID-19 Lockdown <a class="header-anchor" href="#my-experience-during-covid-19-lockdown" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;My Experience during COVID-19 Lockdown&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This is a memory about COVID-19. I can say that I spent almost half of my time at home in 2022. When I was in Shanghai, I was locked in my home for almost three months. By the time we were allowed to go out, it was already summer, and we had missed the beautiful scenery and spring winds. Before the lockdown, we were wearing down coats, but now that it&#39;s over, we&#39;re already wearing T-shirts. The only way we could go outside was to get a permit and do nucleic acid testing, and even then, we had to go back home quickly to avoid infection.</p><p>Staying at home was not the worst thing; the worst thing was not having enough food to eat. During those months, we had to wake up early and use shopping apps to buy food. The app would start selling at 6 am, and within five or six minutes, all the food would be sold out. We tried to buy food every day, but we could only succeed a few times. My friends and family were worried about me, but I didn&#39;t want to make them more anxious, so I told them that I had enough food and everything was fine. I will never forget this experience, and I can&#39;t imagine that in 2022, people couldn&#39;t buy food freely. It&#39;s shocking to think that someone could die of hunger in a peaceful country without war.</p><p>When we finally got to meet our friends, they told us that they had bought one hundred steamed buns to eat. It was really hard for them to live without those steamed buns, and they had to eat them every day until we were allowed to go out. My boyfriend and I lost weight during this time, and I was shocked to see how thin my friend had become. He had lost all his baby fat, and I couldn&#39;t believe it. But the only thing we were sure of was that we had gone through a difficult time.</p>',10)]))}const w=t(i,[["render",d]]);export{f as __pageData,w as default};
